        <p>The Telos Lifestyle Revolution is split into three parts, Thoughts, Emotions, and Actions, and each part has three exercises. The exercises are not physical exercises, require nothing more than maybe a pen and some paper, and only take a couple of minutes per day to complete.</p>

        <h2>The Motivation Equation</h2>
        <p>Created by Professor Piers Steel, the Motivation Equation measures the level of motivation you have to maintain a particular habit or reach a defined goal.

        <h4>Expectancy x Value / Impulsiveness x Delay = Motivation</h4>
