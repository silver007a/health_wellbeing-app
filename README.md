# A Health & Wellbeing Desktop App

An Desktop App Designed to Help a Person Improve their Quality Of Life By Answering Simple Questions

The goal of this project is to create a mobile app that aims to help a person improve their quality of life. The app will ask the user simple questions. The user will attain points for each answer. The user will have access to pages that provide textual, audio, and video instructions and lessons. The app will use gamification to help engage the user. The user will have access to usage and progress reports to track improvement. 

### MVP

**A user should be able to:**

* View pages that includes textual, audio, and video content.
* Create, edit, and delete questions.
* Input answers to questions.


**The app should provide:**


  * A scoring system based on user interaction: questions answered, content pages visited.

  * Scores should be wighted based on set criteria.


### Example extensions

 
* Graphs to show improvement and user activity.

* In-game sound bites to stimulate app usage.

* A user avatar that morphs based on user score, i.e. from  beginner to expert.

* A user can receive bonus points to increase involvement, i.e. for reaching targets, or randomly.

* A user can receive push notifications (reminders, tips, quotes) to enhance interaction.

* A user can invite other people to play.

* A user can play against and challenge other players.

* mobile version (React Native/Firebase?)
